Projet FLIGHT
Consider the following paper
• https://www.dropbox.com/s/4rqnjueuqi5e0uo/TIST-Flight-Delay-final.pdf
• Half of the paper is dedicated to data preparation by preprocesing and opportunely joining complex datasets about flights and
weather conditions
• CSV files are here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iasq7frk6f58ptq/AAAzSmk6cusSNfqYNYsnLGIXa
• The report should detail each step, comment encountered difficulties and how these have been overcome.
• Data preparation and transformation are time-consuming, the join operation is rather complex
• Decision-tree, use Spark ML (do not implement it from scratch)
• Use of other models are welcome
• First local machine (or Databricks) on a small amount of data, and then on the cluster on larger datasets.
• Th project language is Scala
• Deadline : 2 weeks before the presentation
• Report : at least 20 pages, if many pages use 1 or more appendix for additional material
